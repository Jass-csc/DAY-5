# DAY-5
I am Jaskiran kaur from department of 'COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING'.
hello, today we learn about the topic 'PC AND  NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING'.

After knowing this topic , first coming question in our mind.

# :sparkles: "what is troubleshooting?"
This is a basic knowledge but sometimes we don't know the exact meaning of troubleshooting, here is the answer of this question,
Troubleshooting is the process of identifying, diagnosing, and resolving problems or issues—especially with systems, machines, or software.
In simple terms: Troubleshooting means figuring out what’s wrong and how to fix it.

🔄 Types of HDDs:

1. SATA (Serial ATA):  Most common in laptops and desktops. Affordable and widely supported. Speeds up to 6 Gbps.
2. PATA (Parallel ATA/IDE):  Older technology. Slow and bulky. Mostly obsolete.
3. SCSI (Small Computer System Interface): SCSI (Small Computer System Interface).
4.  SAS (Serial Attached SCSI): Faster and more durable than SATA. Used in data centers and high-performance servers.
5. USB (External HDDs): Portable drives connected via USB. Used for backups and extra storage.

## BSOD (BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH): 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fe4ab9e-b9e0-4569-b927-f5573d65a938)

BSOD stands for Blue Screen of Death—a critical error screen displayed by Windows when the system encounters a serious issue it can’t recover from.
It's a sign that something went very wrong at the hardware or low-level software level.

🧠 Why BSOD Happens (Common Causes):
| Cause Type                  | Examples                                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **Driver Issues**         | Corrupt, outdated, or incompatible drivers     |
| 🔧 **Hardware Failure**     | RAM errors, overheating, faulty hard drive     |
| 🧪 **Corrupt System Files** | Damaged Windows files or boot errors           |
| 🛠 **Bad Updates**          | Faulty Windows or driver updates               |
| 🦠 **Malware or Virus**     | Deep infection damaging system-level processes |
| 🧱 **Overclocking/BIOS**    | Incorrect CPU, RAM, or GPU settings            |
---

🧾 What Happens When BSOD Occurs:

    The screen turns blue with an error code like:

        CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED

        MEMORY_MANAGEMENT

        IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

        PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA

    Windows restarts automatically unless disabled.
---
  🛠️ How to Fix BSOD (Step-by-Step):
✅ 1. Note the Error Code

Take a photo or write down the error name (e.g. VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE).
🔄 2. Restart in Safe Mode

    Boot into Safe Mode using Shift + Restart.

    This runs Windows with minimal drivers and services.

🧹 3. Update or Roll Back Drivers

    Use Device Manager to check for:

        Display adapters (graphics)

        Network drivers

        Storage controllers

    Roll back recently updated drivers if the BSOD started after a driver change.

🛡️ 4. Run Virus & Malware Scan

Use Windows Defender or Malwarebytes to rule out infections.

🧪 5. Run Diagnostic Tools

| Tool              | Command                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Check disk errors | `chkdsk /f /r` (run in CMD as admin) |
| System file check | `sfc /scannow`                       |
| Memory test       | Windows Memory Diagnostic            |
 ---

🔧 6. Undo Recent Changes

    Uninstall new software, Windows updates, or hardware.

    Use System Restore to roll back to a stable point.

⚙️ 7. Update BIOS/Firmware (Advanced)

Go to your motherboard or laptop manufacturer’s website to check for BIOS updates.
---

📌 Tips to Prevent BSOD:

    Keep drivers & Windows updated.

    Don’t install random/untrusted software.

    Use reliable antivirus.

    Don’t overclock unless you know what you're doing.

    Keep your PC clean and cool to avoid overheating.
